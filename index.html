                If your thinking that i love math,well i did.I am a sister to two amazing children,a daughter to a wonderful
                very hardworking dad and to the kindest and purest mom.I am  an extremely fan of books and music.Listener to all kinds of music

            <p> My journey as a young teenage girl programmer started since innovation academy was open.
                Since then programming has been a part of my daily routine.
                Being a girl isn't easy,but being a girl programmer sometimes is even hard.
                You go through dissapoinments,doubts,stressful late nights,edginess that most of the times is caused by
                the opposite gender.
                It takes time,it takes hard work and a lot of commitment but being a girl and following this path is not
                a weakness ,it's a strength itself.</p>

                Y'all probably will laugh with this.These last months i don't know where it came from but i'm literally number 1 fan of cats. i just think they're the purest form of living species on this earth. Probably a big part of you don't like them just like my mom and that's the only reason i don't have one. I would like if some of you would help them and why not adopt one of them.
